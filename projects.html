<b>Title:</b>ROBOKISAN-AUTONOMOUS SOLAR POWERED VOICE CONTROLLED MULTILINGUAL SUPPORT OVER IOT
<b>Aim:</b><i>The proposed project deals with the innovative concept of Robokisan- An autonomous
    solar powered agricultural Robot which can be controlled over IOT using speech recognition system. 
    The system is expected to provide farmers with an multipurpose autonomous 
    robot to carry out day to day agricultural tasks. The innovation is in
    the speech recognition method used to control IOT devices using local languge. 
    The farmer can reside anywhere in the world and give voice commands in local language
    to operate the machine.The machine is completely autonomous and completes the task given
    by the farmer remotely and autonomously using internet of things protocols.
